# üß† Student Mental Health Analysis Using Machine Learning

This repository contains code and resources for the research project **"Student Mental Health Analysis Using Machine Learning"**. The goal is to analyze the factors affecting student mental health and build predictive models to identify students who may be at risk.

## üìå Project Overview

Mental health among students is a growing concern, especially with the rise of academic pressure, online learning environments, and social isolation. This project aims to analyze mental health survey data to:

- Understand key factors influencing student mental health
- Predict whether a student is likely to experience mental health issues
- Provide data-driven insights to help universities and counselors take early action

## üìä Dataset

- **Source**: [Kaggle - Student Mental Health Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/)  

- **Attributes** may include:
  - Gender
  - Age
  - Course/Field of Study
  - Year of Study
  - Academic Performance
  - Sleep habits
  - Exercise frequency
  - Access to mental health resources
  - Stress level, anxiety, and depression indicators

- **Target**: Mental health status (e.g., "Needs support" / "Stable")

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values
   - Label encoding / one-hot encoding for categorical variables
   - Feature normalization or scaling

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Correlation analysis
   - Visualization of mental health trends by gender, academic year, habits, etc.
   - Distribution plots and heatmaps

3. **Modeling**
   - Logistic Regression
   - Random Forest
   - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
   - Gradient Boosting Classifier (e.g., XGBoost)

4. **Evaluation Metrics**
   - Accuracy
   - Precision, Recall, F1-Score
   - ROC-AUC Curve
   - Confusion Matrix
